## Question 5: Show that a + a = 2a
We know that 2 is Bool:
```
a + a = 2a
Either a a = (Bool, a)
```
If the above expression were to be true there would be a function f 
that takes an Either a a and outputs a (Bool, a) and the inverse of that function
f'
```
f :: Either a a -> (Bool, a)
f (Left x) = (True, x)
f (Right x) = (False, x)
f' :: (Bool, a) -> Either a a
f' (True, x) = Left x
f' (False, x) = Right x
```
