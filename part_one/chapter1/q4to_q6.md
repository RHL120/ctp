## Question 4: Is the world-wide web a category in any sense? Are links morphisms?
If the world wide web were to be considered a category and websites were to be
considered the objects in that categories, would be the morphisms
except that websites need not have links to themselves thus the web can not be
a category
## Question 5: Is Facebook a category, with people objects and friends as morphisms?
As far as I can tell, on Facebook, it is impossible for one to be friends with
themselves so objects can never have identity morphisms thus Facebook is not a
category
