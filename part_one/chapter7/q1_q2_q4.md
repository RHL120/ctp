# Chapter 7
## Question 1: Can we turn the Maybe type constructor into a function by defining fmap _ _ = Nothing
```fmap _ _ = Nothing``` breaks id, for example: ```fmap id (Just 0) = Nothing```
## Question 2: Prove functor laws for the reader functor
Inorder for Reader to be a functor it should satisfy, the id law and the
composition law.

We start with the id law:
```
f :: a -> b --this is a reader
g = id <$> f
  = id . f
  = f
```
Thus Reader satisfies the id law
Then we move one to the composition law:
```
f :: a -> b
g :: b -> c
h :: c -> d
fmap (h . g) f = (h . g) . f
               = h . g . f
------
fmap h (fmap g f)
               = h . (fmap g f)
	       = h . (g . f)
	       = h . g . f
<=> fmap (h . g) f = fmap f (fmap g f) = h . g . f
```
Thus Reader satisfies the composition law
