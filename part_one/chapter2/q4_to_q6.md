# Chapter 2
## Question 4: Which C++ functions are pure
The pure functions are:
* (a) The factorial function from the example in the text
## Question 5: How many different functions are there from Bool to Bool?
It depends, There is an infinte amount of functions that take a Bool and return
a Bool but the can always be simplified to the following functions:
```haskell
not True = False
not False = True
id True = True
id False = False
```
id could also be written as ```not not```

## Question 6: Draw a category between Void, () and Bool
